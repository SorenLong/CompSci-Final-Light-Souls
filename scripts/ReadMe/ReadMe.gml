	I hope you enjoy this project!
	Any issues send an email to shaun.spalding@gmail.com

	You're free to use any code for your own projects (that's the point!).

	For your own benefit as well as mine though I'd rather you didn't
	use any of the included art assets in commercial projects. 

	They're made by me and some of them I've used in various jam games, 
	presentations and videos and would like to avoid any confusion.

	besides, you wouldn't want to release a game made with tutorial assets
	in the first place really.

	Obvious stuff, just figured I'd say!

	have fun!
